/**
 * The idea here is that we want to allow parent components to update the `value` state
 * at any time â€“ then the selected items should update accordingly.
 *
 * Unfortunately, it led to an infinite loop, when selecting items fast.
 * 1) every click causes an internal change to `selectedItems`
 * 2) this change is synced up using `onStateChange` from `useMultipleSelection`
 * 3) which triggers a change to value and causes a rerender + this effect to re-run
 * 4) but this effect will already have a new state for selectedItems
 * 5) so we're calling setSelectedItems with an outdated value
 *
 * => To counter this, we introduced a "syncing" boolean, which we set true in 2) and double-check before 5)
 *
 * This works, but there is probably a better way to solve this,
 * like trying to tie `value` to `selectedItems` more directly
 * (= having more of a "controled component state").
